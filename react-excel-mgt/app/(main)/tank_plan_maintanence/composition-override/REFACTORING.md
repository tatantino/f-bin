# Composition Override Component Refactoring

This document outlines the refactoring changes made to the Composition Override feature to improve code organization, readability, and maintainability.

## Architecture Improvements

### 1. Separation of Concerns

The refactoring focused on properly separating concerns between:

- **Service Layer**: Pure data operations and business rules
- **Hook Layer**: State management and UI feedback
- **Component Layer**: UI rendering

### 2. Business Logic Relocation

- Moved business logic functions like `createNewRow` and `toggleDeleteStatus` from service to hook layer
- Relocated date validation function to the service layer where it belongs
- Improved error handling throughout the application

### 3. Component Structure

- Enhanced the Table component to focus on rendering
- Improved ActionCell and ChangeTypeCell components with more declarative approaches
- Added better error handling in the page component

## Key Changes

### Service Layer

- Added proper date validation
- Enhanced business rules application
- Improved error handling with specific messages

### Hook Layer

- Centralized state management in the hook
- Improved error handling with toast notifications
- Moved business logic from components to hooks

### Component Layer

- Simplified components to focus on rendering
- Used more declarative patterns for conditional rendering
- Improved error handling with better error messages

## Code Quality Improvements

- Added proper TypeScript interfaces
- Enhanced documentation with JSDoc comments
- Used more consistent naming conventions
- Extracted configuration objects for better readability
- Improved error handling throughout the application

## Benefits

1. **Improved Readability**: Code is now more organized and easier to understand
2. **Better Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes future changes easier
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: More robust error handling with better user feedback
4. **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript typing throughout the codebase
5. **Consistent Patterns**: More consistent coding patterns across components
